## Dart bytecode

Dart bytecode is a binary representation of dynamic modules
on the VM/AOT. It is generated by dart2bytecode tools and
can be executed by the VM and AOT runtime (built with dynamic modules support).

This document uses notation similar to [Dart kernel binary format](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/kernel/binary.md).
